<h1>The need for nudge8 design</h1>
<p>
While there are many things in our society that we shove down peopleâ€™s throat, it has already become and will be even more difficult to enforce things on people. The fundamental challenge central to the well-being of the humanity has not and will not change. This challenge is how we promote peace, love, and respect. As we start to understand and acknowledge the growing importance of comparative judgement, we have to think deepely about the 'art of presentation.' How can we help people choose one in favor of the other? How can we help people make positive decisions that collectively add up to the greater good of all?
